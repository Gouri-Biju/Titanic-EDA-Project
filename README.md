# Titanic EDA Project

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.

Objective:
Understand survival patterns based on:
- Gender
- Passenger class
- Age
- Fare
- Alone or with family

Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab

Outputs:
- Cleaned dataset: `titanic_cleaned.csv`
- Visual insights (survival rates by group)
- Ready for ML modeling

Machine Learning Model

Built a Logistic Regression model to predict survival:
- Accuracy: 83%
- Evaluated using precision, recall, f1-score
- Features: age, class, sex, fare, etc.

This is part of my data science portfolio. More to come!
